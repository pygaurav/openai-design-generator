## Design from Text

This project allows you to create designs from text and iterate on them until you are satisfied. It uses React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and OpenAI as a service with GPT4 as a model.

**Getting Started**

To get started, clone this repository and install the dependencies:

```
git clone git@github.com:pygaurav/openai-design-generator.git
cd openai-design-generator

```

You can now access the application at http://localhost:5173.

**Usage**

To create a new design, simply enter some text into the input field and click the "Generate" icon. OpenAI will generate a design based on your text, which will be displayed in the preview area.

If you are not satisfied with the design, you can iterate on it by making changes to the text input and clicking the "Generate Design" button again. You can also use the buttons in the preview area to make minor adjustments to the design.
